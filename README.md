# Research Decoder

## Problem Statement

Research papers are written in an **overly complex style** using *scientific and technical jargon* that addresses a specific audience of experts or professionals in the field. This makes it **hard**, **less likely**, and **less interesting** for business professionals or non-experts to want to jump into the research and try to understand it. This is a problem because it ***limits the spread of knowledge*** and makes it hard for people to know about the *amazing research* that is being done.

## Proposed Solution

**Research Decoder** is a solution to this problem. It takes academic papers and translates them into ***plain English anyone can understand***, with *fun and engaging illustrations* using OpenAI's image generation model and *easily understandable explanations* using large language models.
